# Surface Traffic Management Through Reinforcement Learning

Final project for CS 394R by Will Alexander and Carlin Liao.

Run `sac.ipynb` to conduct a training trial after setting hyperparameters as desired in cell 8.

`dta_tester.py` runs 30 trials with a fixed control policy - no tweaking required.
